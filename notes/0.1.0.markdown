## shell commands from sbt shell

[sbt/sbt-sh][1] is a fork of [steppenwells/sbt-sh][2] that's been inactive for a while.
To add sbt-sh as a global plugin, create `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/sh.sbt` (requires sbt 0.13.7):

    addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-sh" % "0.1.0")

This plugin adds the `sh` task. This will execute the rest of the line as a shell command.

    root> sh git status
    [info] On branch wip/sequential
    [info] Your branch is up-to-date with 'upstream/wip/sequential'.
    [info] nothing to commit, working directory clean

## shell emulation

Using sbt's parser combinator and `sbt.Process` API, sbt-sh emulates POSIX shell's pipeline and redirection.

    sbt-sh> sh ls > ls.txt
    [success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 23, 2015 11:00:00 PM
    sbt-sh> sh cat nonexistent.txt || cat ls.txt | wc -l
    [error] cat: nonexistent.txt: No such file or directory
    [info]        7
    [success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 23, 2015 11:00:00 PM
